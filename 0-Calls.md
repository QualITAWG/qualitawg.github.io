## Panels and Keynotes

QualITA panel track is meant to be a unique academic and industrial
forum to discuss different viewpoints concerning gaps and challenges to
be addressed by the CINI WG on System and Service Quality community.
QualITA panels are planned to be delivered in a session of 30 minutes or
1 hour. The conference is intended to be self-funded, and not requiring
any registration fee. For this reason, there will be no economical
support, unless a sponsor is found. Nevertheless, should there be the
possibility of having a volunteer and self-funded Keynote speaker, a
Keynote session could be introduced.

## Open Contributions (blue sky basic research free speech)

The main reason for the QualITA meeting will be to strengthen the CINI
WG on System and Service Quality community, by sharing to the
participants the most recent results and achievements. For this reason
there will be the opportunity of presenting a 20 minutes free speech
contribution, which can be based on recent talks given in international
conferences, on internal presentations, project meetings, summary of the
activities of a research group or brand new ideas (blue sky). PhD
students and young researchers are particularly encouraged to present
their research and experiences.

## Case Study and Industrial Practice

QualITA 23 launches the Quantitative methods in Industrial practice session in
the spirit of highlighting the importance and the impact of quantitative
information technology in the landscape of research partnerships with
companies, especially those located in Italy.
Teams/laboratories/research groups and companies are invited to report
their experiences of collaboration on industrial case studies in the
context of the workshop topics of interest. Experiences that are
generating or have generated “added value”, that is a positive impact
both on research and on the activities generated and products resulting
from collaborations, are particularly welcome. Presentations of
experiences, from which instead emerge critical elements or particular
lessons that may be of interest to both industry and researchers engaged
in the various application and theoretical aspects of Quantitative
Methods in Informatics are also welcome. Alongside speeches by the
academic researchers, it is also strongly recommended the participation
of company representatives, who are invited to participate in the
workshop/session to introduce themselves to the entire community.

## Outlook 2030 Proposal

The concept of quality of computer systems and services has evolved many
times and in many directions since the beginning of computer science and
engineering, following the trajectories and the progress of
corresponding technologies as well as new application domains and
avenues. From microchips and microprocessors, to mainframe and
workstations and thus to distributed systems, Cloud, Fog, Edge, mixed
paradigms, architectures, and infrastructures. From machine languages to
higher level one, to low-no code, microservices, containers, virtualized
environments, with layers of software on top of layers of software, or
even to hybrid, embedded, cyber-physical, socio-technical systems or
systems of systems. This radically changed the quality landscape,
pushing to revise concepts of performance, reliability, dependability,
and security accordingly or even to add new concepts such as
scalability, resilience, sustainability. We are however witnessing a
maturity process moving ideas to technologies faster and faster, where
the focus is quickly moving from functional to non-functional aspects,
to quality ones. Essentially, the question this meeting is willing to
address is “What’s next?”

The goal of the session is to stimulate the discussion around topics,
proposed by researchers and practitioners, which will guide the next
evolution of digital system and service quality in the upcoming years.
One of the main outcomes of the meeting will be an initial draft of a
manifesto – to be finalized in the following period as a scientific
paper for a top journal in the field – helpful for our community.

We call for you to participate in this gathering with the key objectives of:

- Presenting your current work in defining new approaches in the area of system and service quality
- Presenting your vision of system and service quality in 2030
- Attending the meeting to contribute to the discussion

## Submission Instructions

QualITA 23 accepts contributions covering all aspects of quality, such as monitoring, benchmarking, measuring, modeling, assessing, capacity planning, workload characterization, operational analysis, verification, validation, and testing. Both methodological and practical aspects are taken into account, including any technique (e.g. analytical models, simulators, statistical analysis, machine learning, formal methods, soft computing) and tool, in any possible digital system and service application domain (e.g. real-time, blockchain, systems of systems, cyber-physical systems, IoT, Cloud, Fog, Edge, Intelligent transportation systems, fintech, digital health, blockchain).
According to the spirit of the conference, the review process will be aimed at providing comments that could be used by the authors mostly for strengthening the contribution form, making them accessible and useful for the broad audience, and increasing the likelihood of generating fruitful discussions. 

- Deadline: April, 14th
