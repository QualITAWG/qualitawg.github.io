## Panels and Keynotes
QualITA panel track is meant to be a unique academic and industrial forum to discuss different viewpoints concerning gaps and challenges to be addressed by the CINI WG on System and Service Quality community. QualITA panels are 15-minutes talks that are planned to be delivered in a session of 30 minutes or 1 hour. This Panels and Keynotes call for contributions offers an opportunity for researchers and practitioners who wish to further explore or expand upon their work in a broader and more interactive setting. The format is designed to increase visibility for presenters while providing dedicated space to highlight emerging topics, foster discussion, and stimulate new lines of inquiry within the community.

## Consolidated Works and Mature Results
The QualITA track on Consolidated Works and Mature Results provides a venue for authors who wish to present solid, well-established research outcomes that have reached a high level of maturity. This track welcomes contributions that synthesize, extend, or reflect upon previously published work, as well as studies that offer comprehensive analyses, validated methodologies, or refined results derived from extensive experimentation or long-term projects. The goal is to provide a venue for showcasing consolidated knowledge, enabling the community to learn from robust findings, appreciate the evolution of ongoing research lines, and foster discussions on the impact, lessons learned, and future directions emerging from mature contributions.


## Emerging Ideas, Early Results, Feedback & Collaboration
QualITA26 welcomes submissions dedicated to researchers and practitioners who wish to share novel ideas, preliminary findings, or ongoing work that can benefit from early visibility within the community. This track welcomes contributions that present innovative directions, exploratory research, or open problems where feedback from peers can significantly strengthen the next stages of development. It also serves as a space to propose collaborative initiatives, seek partners for future studies, or open discussions around emerging challenges and opportunities. The goal is to foster an open, constructive, and forward-looking environment in which early-stage research can grow, mature, and connect with potential collaborators across academia and industry.



## Submission Format

QualITA26 submissions are single-blind and should use the official [ACM Primary Article Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) of the companion conference, ICPE.
More specifically, the double column formats have to be used for all paper submissions.

All submissions must stay within the maximum length for workshop papers: up to 10 pages, including references.
- Full paper: up to 10 pages, including references.
- Short papar: 5 pages and under, plus references.

## Submission System
Submissions need to be uploaded to the submission system on HotCRP (the submission links will be added soon).

## Proceedings
All papers submitted to "Consolidated Works and Mature Results" track will be published in the ICPE 2026 conference proceedings that will be published by ACM and included in the ACM Digital Library. 
Emerging Ideas, Early Results, Feedback & Collaboration will not be included in the proceedings.

## Open Access Publishing
Starting 2026, all articles published by ACM – including all papers published in the ICPE 2026 proceedings – will be made Open Access (freely available on the public internet). This is greatly beneficial to the advancement of computer science and leads to increased usage and citation of research.

However, this may involve the payment of Article Processing Charges (APC) by the authors of ICPE 2026 accepted papers, , subject to the following rules:

- **APC Waiver (ACM Open)**: Most authors will be covered by ACM Open agreements between their institution and ACM. A paper will be published free of charge if its corresponding author (who does not need to be the first author of the paper) is affiliated with a participating institution. [Check if your institution participates in ACM Open](https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants).

- **Geographic Waivers & Discounts**: Papers whose authors are not covered by ACM Open agreements may qualify for several automated and discretionary Geographic APC Waivers and Discounts offered by ACM, typically based on the corresponding author’s affiliation with an institution in a low-income or lower-middle-income country. See [ACM’s Policy on Geographic APC Waivers and Discounts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-open-access-apc-waivers-and-discounts).

- **Automatic Waivers (Short Papers)**: Short workshop papers (5 pages and under, plus references) and NIER papers will be published free of charge.

- **Subsidized APC (Full Papers)**: For ICPE 2026 papers that do not qualify for any of the waivers above, a subsidized APC will be payable:
  - $250 (US dollars) when at least one of the named co-authors is an ACM or ACM Special Interest Group (SIG) member.
  - $350 (US dollars) when none of the named co-authors is an ACM or SIG Member.
This fee is payable when the camera-ready version of the accepted paper is uploaded.

## Registration Instructions
Registration link will be available soon.
