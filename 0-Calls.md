## Panels and Keynotes

QualITA panel track is meant to be a unique academic and industrial forum to discuss different viewpoints concerning 
gaps and challenges to be addressed by the CINI WG on System and Service Quality community.  QualITA panels are planned to be delivered 
in a session of 30 minutes or 1 hour. The conference is intended to be self-funded, and not requiring any registration fee. 
For this reason, there will be no economical support, unless a sponsor is found. Nevertheless, should there be the possibility 
of having a volunteer and self-funded Keynote speaker, a Keynote session could be introduced.

## OPEN CONTRIBUTIONS [Blue Sky Basic Research Free speech]

The main reason for the QualITA meeting will be to strengthen the CINI WG on System and Service Quality community, 
by sharing to the participants the most recent results and achievements. For this reason there will be the opportunity of 
presenting a 20 minutes free speech contribution, which can be based on recent talks given in international conferences, 
on internal presentations, project meetings, summary of the activities of a research group or brand new ideas (blue sky). 
PhD students and young researchers are particularly encouraged to present their research and experiences.
