## Overview

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The fifth Italian Conference on System and Service Quality (QualITA 2026) 
is the annual event of the <a href="https://www.consorzio-cini.it/index.php/it/gdl/system-and-service-quality">
CINI System and Service Quality Working Group</a>. 
Its main goal is to put together Italian researchers, 
practitioners and professionals from academia, industry and public administration
interested in qualities of computing systems such as performance, dependability, 
trustworthiness, efficiency, resilience, sustainability, and others. 
The conference will be structured into different research tracks, 
selected keynote speeches and some panels on related topics.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
QualITA 2026 aims to highlight quality aspects, considering the complex,
heterogeneous, multidisciplinary environment in which modern computing systems operate, 
together with their application domains, characterized by an increasing demand of resilient 
and sustainable solutions that should also meet efficiency as well as time-constrained requirements. 
</p>

### Topics
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Technologies such as Cloud computing, IoT, 5G networks, Big Data, and AI have started 
becoming mature enough, turning the peak of inflated expectations and disillusionment 
towards effective solutions into enlightenment. To move further towards the plateau of 
productivity, the focus switches from functional to non-functional aspects, from mechanisms 
to qualities and policies for their enforcement, and from a proof of concept or prototype 
to a product or service. Therefore, techniques and tools to deal with quality aspects 
in the design, implementation, and assessment of computing systems become essential to 
support such process. QI25 will explore methodological and practical aspects of qualities, 
ranging from modelling and design techniques to evaluation tools and case studies. 
It will also investigate related domains such as cloud, edge, IoT, intelligent systems, 
cyber-physical systems, high-performance computing, blockchain, and similar.
